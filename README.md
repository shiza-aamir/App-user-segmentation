# User Behavior Analysis Project
Welcome to the User Behavior Analysis Project, part of my AICP ML Internship! This project focuses on analyzing user behavior data to extract valuable insights through various data preprocessing and machine learning techniques.
# Project Overview

This project aims to analyze a dataset containing user behavior information. The main tasks include:

1.Data cleaning and preprocessing: Handling null values and checking data types.
2.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generating descriptive statistics and visualizations.
3.Feature Engineering: Creating new features to improve model performance.
4.Model Building: Implementing machine learning models to predict user behavior.

# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is userbehaviour.csv. It contains various features related to user activities on a platform. The key columns include:

1.user_id: Unique identifier for each user
2.session_length: Duration of user sessions
3.actions: Types of actions performed by users
4.time_spent: Time spent on different activities
5.purchase: Indicator of whether a purchase was made
